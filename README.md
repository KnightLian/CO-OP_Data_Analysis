# Response of Confederation Bridge to Ice Forces: Winter 2008-2010, 2010
In order to evaluate the ice impact force acting on offshore structures, two piers of the Confederation Bridge were selected as a test bed for the study of ice interactions. The Confederation Bridge is located in Northumberland Strait in the area of Gulf of St-Lawrence. The Strait is usually covered by a large amount of ice in winter, and the ice is continuously drifting back and forth against the bridge piers with the result that large ice forces are created on the piers. Each pier was designed to sustain 30 MN maximum ice impact force, which provides a high safety factor for the bridge. National Research Council Canada â€“ Canadian Hydraulics Centre (NRC-CHC) installed tiltmeters in two bridge piers for measuring the force of ice interaction. The measured tilt can be interpreted as an applied load based on the structure response; therefore, an indirect system of determining ice iteration forces was established. The wind force acting on the bridge cannot be neglected, so wind data is required for analyzing any ice event where large wind forces are included. In addition to the analyzed digital data, video recordings were used for observing ice failure behaviour during an ice event. A traffic observation camera on the bridge recorded the behaviour of floating ice in a large field of view, and a time lapse video camera installed under the bridge monitored the area around the pier with tiltmeters installed. The information of ice coverage in the Strait was used to assist and identify ice events. The event data was analyzed by using MATLAB. The data analyzed for this report was from measurements in the winters of 2008, 2009 and 2010.
